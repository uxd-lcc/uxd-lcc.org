            You will design and build artefacts that are part of the network
            known as the Internet. They may consume from, publish to or simply
            be situated online.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will gain an understanding of the material of the internet, such
            as interfaces, code, data, and infrastructures, which mediate many
            of our interactions today. We will evaluate the role technologies,
            platforms and design play and how they hold significant social and
            political power. As informed designers we need to understand the
            medium we design for as well as using practical methods to design
            and build for it.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will be introduced to web technologies and practical methods for
            designing and building interfaces, working with data and creating
            dynamic online experiences. You will study and deploy methods from
            information design, employ best practices from interface design and
            regularly consider the user or audience experience. Your
            experimentation, creative process and learning journey should be
            reflected upon personally, through documentation and presentations
            of your concepts.

          <p>
            Create an interactive hypertext narrative that reveals something
            about yourself or an experience you've had. It could be a story
            about yourself, a journey through a topic you're interested in, a
            mode of navigation that mimics your personality, etc. There should
            be multiple HTML pages, linked together by
            <code style="display: inline">&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags. Each page
            could contain text and/or images. No styling. Limit your focus to
            story and interaction.

          <h2>Brief 03: Community Interface</h2>
        </header>
        <section class="ug-txt">
          <p>
            Create a homepage for a community. It can be for a community that
            you're involved with, one that you admire, or a fictional community.
            For instance, a site for a colony of robots that live on the moon, a
            nonprofit organisation of your choice, or a site for a club or
            student group that you're a member of or would like to start. You
            can imagine that this homepage is part of a larger website, but the
            links don't needed to lead anywhere. You can write
            <code style="display: inline"
              >&#x3C;a href=&#x22;#&#x22;&#x3E;my link&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code
            >
            to make a link that goes nowhere.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can try to recreate layout and interface patterns you've seen
            online, or be more experimental with your design. In any case, your
            design should be clearly informed by the content it is representing.
            Ask yourself, how can you use web design to communicate an idea,
            identity, and community?
          </p>

          <p>
            Your design does not need to be responsive, but should work on
            either a standard laptop monitor or a mobile phone (your choice).
            When you post your project link, also post a screenshot as it looks
            on your device for reference.
