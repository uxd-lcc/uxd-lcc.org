          You will design, develop, and publish an online portfolio of work reflecting your activities during this unit and the previous years of study on the course. It will include at minimum the two design projects undertaken as part of this unit.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The two projects and portfolio itself will be considered in relation to your current position and future aspirations as a designer, taking into consideration your own goals and the intended audience.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Both projects will be self-initiated - one on a specific theme and the other on a topic chosen by you. Each project will demonstrate your capacity as a designer including emphasis on research, analysis, prototyping and testing. Throughout the various stages of each project consider how you can produce designed artefacts that represent your research and progress using these as both documentation and to inform next steps. These interim outcomes should be realised to an appropriate fidelity and be valuable assets to demonstrate your practice in your portfolio.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects and portfolio should be realised to a high standard and demonstrating your competencies, abilities and personal design identity.

          As part of this unit you will design a portfolio to represent you and your design practice. This will include the two projects you undertake during this unit, as well as selected past work and potentially work in progress, unfinished or ongoing work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This should be accessible online, with a single url as a starting point, but you may also consider alternative, or offline methods of presenting and distributing your work alongside this.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will begin by considering your practice, as well as your personal and professional ambitions. Deciding how you locate yourself in a practice and where you aspire to be are important factors that will determine how you design and populate you portfolio and who it is aimed at.

          <em>Investigate the implementations and implications of Machine Learning.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The field of Machine learning consists of the design, study, and use of algorithms whose performance improves or is defined by examples rather than instructions. Recently, large datasets and fast hardware have enabled the rise of deep learning methods, which make use of artificial neural networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking into account your personal design direction and aims, investigate the field of  Machine Learning. You will not be able to cover the entire field in the time available to you, so it's important to focus your investigation in a way that develops your practice and portfolio of work in the direction you intend.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might consider the <em>implications</em> of Machine Learning: what it means for designers and artists, for society, or for humanity as a whole. Or you might focus on the <em>implementations</em> of Machine Learning: how it's used, or could be used, in different fields such as design, finance, medicine, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't forget the overlap: the implications of the implementations.

        <h2>Self Initiated Project: Write Your Own Brief</h2>
      </header>
      <section class="ug-txt">
        <p>
          Undertake a self-directed design project on a topic of your choosing. As part of this project you will choose a subject to address, define your intentions within this area and produce a project outcome that fulfils those intentions. 
        </p>      
        <p>
          The process will begin through exploratory research and writing a brief. The brief should include a summary of the area, list of proposed reading and research materials, an intended outcome and a consideration of feasibility and timeframe. When writing your briefs, keep in mind that a personal brief is a living document. Your intentions and outcomes will develop alongside your understanding, and this will change as you design and research. You should write your initial brief before starting this project, using the <a href="project-proposal-template.pdf" target="_blank">proposal template</a>, but be prepared to revise this throughout.
        </p>   
        <p>
          You may use the <a href="project-brief-prompts.pdf" target="_blank">brief prompts</a> as a starting point for your project or you may wish to develop an entirely different one in line with your interests.
