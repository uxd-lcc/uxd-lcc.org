            In developing a major project proposal, you will need to consider
            your experience of, and knowledge gathered in, your studies sofar,
            and your future aims as a designer. You should be ambitious in
            defining your areas of research and practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may continue from your previous work in the Digital Design
            Portfolio, draw particular threads from it, or begin a new project
            entirely.This is an opportunity to position yourself as a
            practitioner within the world of design. Consider what kind of
            research you will undertake, the type of work you want to be making,
            how you will make it, and what your aims and intentions are in
            releasing this into the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            This needs to be a project you can complete to a high standard
            within the time available. This project will usually be presented at
            agraduate showcase butdoes not necessarily need to be ready for
            showcase presentation. Your work mayexist in multiple different
            contextsand there will be a short period of time after the hand in
            to prepare it for the showcase and your portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Submissions should include research and process reflection and must
            also contain comprehensive documentation of a completed, designed
            and functional project.
