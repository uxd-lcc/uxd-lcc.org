        <p>
          This unit introduces you to interactive data visualisation both technically and conceptually building upon the long established practice of information design. You will interrogate selected data sets and produce interactive visualisations that enhance understanding and communication. You will also be introduced to the ethical dimension of data collection and asked to consider your intentions and responsibility when selecting and visually representing data. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be introduced to forming and managing data sets and prepare them to be visualised. This unit will revisit design methods and processes that will help you to create meaningful outcomes driven by data. You will use existing platforms and tools for data manipulation and visualisation and be encouraged to develop your own solutions through coding and other media.  
        </p>
        <p>
          You will produce a portfolio of work documenting the outcomes for each set project and other outcomes throughout the unit. This will also include a research weblog and/or sketchbook documenting your iterative design and development process specifically in the areas of interactive data visualisation.

        <h2>Brief: Borders &amp; Boundaries</h2>
      </header>
      <section class="ug-txt">
        <p>
          <em>Brief Top Line</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Produce an interactive visualisation of data collected from a border, allowing it to be perceived, narrated, or explored. The visualisation should tell, or allow others to tell, stories about your chosen border. You will need to consider your intentions as a designer in producing work about this border. What do you want to make visible and what change do you want to enable?
        </p>   
        <p>
          <em>Context</em>
        </p> 
        <p>
          1<br/>The definition of a border here can be widely considered. When humans create borders they “cut a portion out of the continuity and infinity of space and [arrange] this into a particular unity in accordance with a single meaning” (Simmel).  In this sense, the border - as with the measurements and decisions which create data - is a device of categorisation. What, or who, is within the border? What, or who, is kept ‘outside’? Who, or what, makes these decisions, and on what basis? Mimi Ounouha’s project ‘The Library of Missing Datasets’ makes these decisions visible by showing datasets that don’t exist, calling them “blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated”.
        </p>      
        <p>2<br/>"Looking up in the night sky, we imagine the stars to be invisibly connected by ghostly lines into constellations. Only by doing so can we tell stories about them."<br/>- Tim Ingold, Lines<br/></p>
        <p>Borders often fall into Tim Ingold’s category of 'Ghostly Lines', lines which do not "have real phenomenal presence in the environment". They may not be perceptible in place but come into visibility through measurements and representations, traces, on artefacts such as maps. Despite this, they can of course "have very real consequences for people’s movements".</p>
        <p>This visibility or presence can vary along the length of a border, while their consequences often remain the same. The border crossing between states, for example, is mechanised and highly visible in transport locations such as airports, but often much more porous at others. It may be related to physical features but is just as likely to spring from social, political or historical contexts.</p>
        <p>3<br/>The border between public and private space is often difficult to spot. When a plaza in a city such as London presents itself as an open, accessible space the tendency is to assume that it is public, but there are often complex, hidden sets of rules that are de-facto agreed to by stepping over its border.</p>
        <p>Borders are not only physical. There is a similar process at work when crossing the border from the open web to a platform such as a social network or application, or when navigating through these</p>
        <p>+<br/>Design can allow us to read or understand these ‘Ghostly Lines’, and different forms will enable this in different ways. A map, for example, might show otherwise invisible geopolitical boundaries, but a travel guide might provide more historical context. A sky chart will show us constellations, but a myth might tell us more about the societies that first identified them.<br/></p>
        <p>
          <em>Outcomes</em>
        </p>
        <p>Consider the stories you want to tell about your border. Are they about people? Politics? The surrounding geography? The role of technology? What form should your data take to best enable this? It could be a screen-based visualisation, a physical manifestation, a tool for a particular user or set of users...</p>
        <p>You should identify your border and different sources of data to collect or produce from it as soon as possible - this will form the basis of your outcome.</p>

      <section class="ug-txt">
        <p>
          <em>Brief Top Line</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Produce an experience or interface that uses data about or related to the Covid-19 pandemic to inform behaviour change in your chosen users. 
        </p>   
        <p>
          <em>Context</em>
        </p> 
        <p>
          During the pandemic data, statistics and charts have saturated our news media and public consciousness. Shifting data points visualised in charts are presented as more meaningful and consequential for public health and our daily lives than ever before. 
        </p>      
        <p>Despite these morbid implications the data alone is often not enough to change behaviour or incite action in the intended groups - threats, enforcement, and legislation are often also needed. Much like other disasters on a global scale, for example climate change, the sheer scale of a problem can cause a crisis of agency - a feeling of helplessness. 
        </p>
        <p>In the current moment of perpetual crisis and constant change what role can design play in making data useful or persuasive? 
        </p>
        <p>There are immediate pressing concerns and debilitating circumstances that surround day to day life for some people in a pandemic, many of which could be helped by the informative design. But a crisis is also a moment for reflection - an inflection point that can catalyse societal change. What can data and design show us about this moment that could help people imagine a different possible future? 
        </p>
        <p>"Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change." <br/>Milton Friedman
        </p>
        <p>Informing positive behaviour change is a challenging task, partially because people are 'predictably irrational' (Ariely, D. 2009). Therefore as a designer you will need to go beyond the simple presentation and consider what kind of behaviour change you would like to encourage and in who. In what context will your data be presented or consumed and what are are the factors that can affect its reception?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Outcomes</em>
        </p>
        <p>The outcomes of this project must be perceptible, intelligible or discoverable data representations. The data can be graphical, sonified, performed or constructed in spatial form, providing that the data responds to, or is controlled by, the environment or user(s).

          You should submit a PDF that documents through text, illustration and imagery your visual and theoretical research, and the development of your project. The PDF should be reflective; not only describing what you did but what you learned, what went wrong and what you might have done differently.
        </p>
        <p>You can use external links from your PDF to a blog or online notes that illustrate your process in more detail. External links can add context and make your process and thinking more apparent.
