          <p>
            This unit introduces you to both user experience design and user interface design and explores the relationship between the two.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be introduced to user-centred design methods and specific user testing approaches, processes and technologies in the context of interactive digital design. Working with the understanding gained from these processes you will apply your graphic design skills to the production of user interfaces for a range of digital interactive scenarios such as apps and websites. This approach aims to give you an understanding of the visual development of digital content from both a user centred and aesthetic perspective. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Design School is committed to ecologically and socially responsible design. You can refer to the Responsible Design Framework and talk to your tutor about how your research and practice for this assignment can follow sustainable processes and have positive impact.

          <h2>Brief: The UX Of Convenience</h2>
        </header>
        <section class="ug-txt">
          <p>
            <em>Design a way to address the negative impacts of convenience consumerism.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Globalised supply chains and international trade have made it possible for consumers to access an ever growing range of products from around the world whilst rapid online delivery services have given us a sense that our needs can be met almost instantaneously. The common UX design goals are often to support these two characteristics of managing choice and delivering immediacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            This profitable culture of convenience has lead to significant undesirable consequences for our natural world, such as the proliferation of illegal logging of European forests that provide wood for cheap furniture or the levelling of vast areas of Amazon rainforest to meet the demand for palm oil, soy, bananas, coffee or citrus fruits.
          </p>        
          <p>
            At the other end of the supply chain our shopping habits have changed with online delivery becoming faster and more regular. The increase in purchases and repeated delivery attempts mean increases in delivery vehicles on the road adding to congestion, air pollution and global warming.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UX of commerce is often about reducing friction and increasing access to products, which appeals to the desire for immediate gratification, however the needs, desires and motivations of the user are often much more complex and nuanced than this. There is a growing awareness of our impact on the environment and this is already changing habits and behaviours. Your challenge in this brief is not to blame or shame individuals, but to empower them and/or to help positively support changes to the system of convenience consumerism.
