        <p>
          This unit introduces you to User Experience Design. as your chosen course and specialism, and in particular in the context of study at a Higher Education level. It will also orientate you within your course, the College and the University
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Intro To</em> unit runs across both the Contextual Theoretical Studies (CTS) and Studio components of your course and you will be encouraged to explore the ways you can integrate paractical and theoretical aspects of the discipline. We will also discuss studentship, the importance of being an engaged and participatory member of the group and your own personal and professional development.

        <h2>Brief: Drawing Systems</h2>
      </header>
      <section class="ug-txt">
        <p>
          <em>Design and implement/run a rule-based system which generates a series of images.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          You (<em>the Designer</em>) will design and write, or otherwise record, a set of rules that describe a system of image generation. This will then be run by another member of the class (<em>the Implementor</em>) who will give you the images. You'll need to consider how you use design to communicate your intentions to <em>the Implementor</em>, you might need to write a series of rules, provide diagrams or instructions, create custom tools or software for them to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process <em>the Implementor</em> follows should produce at least 20 images, which you will edit down to a set of 10 to present alongside the rules and tools used.
        </p>
        <h3>Context</h3>        
        <p>
          Images or forms can be created or designed directly: we can place pixels, draw lines or shape lumps of clay. They can also be designed in a less direct way, by creating a set of rules for how someone or something else might create or design them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The American artist Sol LeWitt is well known for his large scale wall drawings. LeWitt didn’t draw these himself, but sent instructions to the galleries in which they were exhibited to allow a third party to produce them. For LeWitt, the artistic process was in the planning and decisions that went into these instructions, rather than in the execution of the drawing, saying that “the idea becomes the machine that makes the art”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, many designers and artists write code - instructions for a computer - as part of their practice, using computation as a medium to generate images and forms. This project will introduce you to that process.
        </p>
        <p>
          When writing your instructions, consider the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          How much control do you want over the outcome? How much chance will you allow to enter your system?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there a particular place, space, time, or mindset <em>the Implementor</em> will need to be in to   follow your instructions?
        </p>
        <p>
          What does <em>the Implementor</em> need to understand in order to follow your rules? Do you need to give them any special tools? How can you make use of their particular skills or knowledges?
        </p>
