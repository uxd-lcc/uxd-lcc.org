            This unit offers the chance to engage in an additional selected design competition project.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be presented with a range of briefs or open calls, selected from design competitions, award schemes and international art and design festivals. You will choose an appropriate brief based on your interests and current or desired design practice. You will analyse the brief and requirements, identify audience,project scopeand develop an appropriate proposal and design response. You may also find your own briefs or calls to respond to in discussion with your tutors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The response to the brief will take the form of a proposal aimed at the awarding body or judges of the brief, reflecting this in tone and content. This document should focus on research findings/insights, evidence for your design decisions and documenting any proof of concept or prototype you make. You should carefully consider how to present your research -focussing on how to make your thinking visible in a well-designed and professional way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PDF submission will include a link to this proposal and a detailed reflection on and documentation of your learning, which will demonstrate that you have met the learning outcomes.
