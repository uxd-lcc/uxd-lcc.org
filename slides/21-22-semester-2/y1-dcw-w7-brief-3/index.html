## Summary - Project 3: Collections 

???
Individual projects.  
Deadline/Final Crit: Tue 31st May. 6 Weeks.

- Critique and assess the design of existing physical & digital collections and systems of organisation   
- Start, evolve, organise and document a personal collection, taking into consideration your personal motivations and intended audience for the collection
- Experiment with different visual strategies for presenting your collection and making it explorable for your audience
- Plan and document your process in order to design an effective online interface for your collection 
- Produce, test and iterate on work-in-progress, low fidelity design concepts through to high-fidelity, interactive prototypes
- Experiment with code to prototype a specific, interactive component of the design  

Speakers during this brief:
- 2 x about ecological impact of Internet
- 1 x designer speaking about process

## Collections and Collecting

### What are the motivations to collect?

###### What are the motivations to collect?
* ##### Collecting for curiosity
* ##### Collecting to remember
* ##### Collecting as ownership
* ##### Collecting to preserve
* ##### ...?
* ##### ...?
* ##### ...?

???
* Collecting as ownership
* Collecting for curiosity
* Collecting to remember
* Collecting to preserve
* Collecting to learn or teach
* Collecting to tell stories 
* Collecting to create visibility

???
Stuff and consumerism. Accumulation of valuable things.
Ownership is a way of being in consumer culture. Continuous growth.
Drive to collect is partially about 'use value' + aesthetics but also status and occasionally investment.

---

![Aesthetics - Young boy and girl in rooms surrounded by things](https://payload.cargocollective.com/1/3/97774/5002171/1_1_2200.jpg)

???
Impulse starts young.
But why do we keep things beyond their use value? 
Or collect things are are already 'useless'?
Deeper psychological motivations? Safety? Anxiety? Fear of losing the past?
Some things are personal or sentimental, others are for status and their implied value 
Is it possible we just like 'things'??

???
A lot of these collecitons are a legacy of the colonial impulse. 
To explore, exploit and capture the 'exotic'. Essentially stealing. 
Read more about this in [Post-colonial studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism) and Edward Said:

> ..., Orientalist scholarship implies that the colonial subaltern (the colonised people) were incapable of thinking, acting, or speaking for themselves, thus are incapable of writing their own national histories.
[Edward Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said) writes about representations of cultures by colonial powers in his book Orientalism.

###### Task
#### Add examples of some publicly facing collections you are inspired by, that you have visited or would like to visit.

Ownership. Prowess of capturing the exotic. And creating knowledge.
Some notable institutions started this often during their colonial period.
British Museum amongst them.
Cabinets of curiosity. Cabinet originally referrered to a room, not a cabinet as we know it. 
They were collected of usually natural or ethnographic created by wealthy individuals.

Urban history project. Accidentally surfaced objects when Amsterdam city dug a metro line under the river Amstel. 
Breadth of culture spanning over 2000BC to 2005. 
Fossils of 4000 year old animals to medieval jewelry/cereamics to discarded mobile phones, credit cards, keys, earings, dentures 
Some natural history as well as documentation of consumer culture. Individual histories.  

Visibility is controlled by institutional power. i.e. Not everyone can contribute. 
Wider audiences. Knowledge is 'free' online.
items that wouldn't be considered appropriate for a museum

---

class: middle

> #### Urban histories can be told in a thousand ways. 

???
> The archaeological research project of the North/South metro line lends the River Amstel a voice in the historical portrayal of Amsterdam. The Amstel was once the vital artery, the central axis, of the city. Along the banks of the Amstel, at its mouth in the IJ, a small trading port originated about 800 years ago. At Damrak and Rokin in the city centre, archaeologists had a chance to physically access the riverbed, thanks to the excavations for the massive infrastructure project of the North/South metro line between 2003 and 2012.

SPeaks to breadth of collection
but also potential for collections to be presented or interpreted many ways.

###### In Summary 
#### Online collections have the potential to be more esoteric, egalitarian, representative and collaboratively created

???
They can be larger and reach a limitless audience but this ambition is unhelpful and unlkely. Scale isn't the goal and you should choose the audience(s) based on your collections goal.

---

###### Task
#### Add examples of online collections you have found useful, inspiring or regularly used.

###### Collecting and curation. 

#### Posting something to a timeline, bookmarking a website, writing a note to yourself is a form of collection, and often curation.

---
###### Collecting and curation. 

#### But we are only partially in control of this process. It's often driven by our anxieties and encouraged by the platforms.

???
Driven by the wealth of information & stuff available to us it's a response of anxiety or fear. 
And encouraging the collection is the lifeblood for social media and tech companies.
These acts are encouraged because they create value for the platforms.
Creates the data that allows them to understand us better. Serve us adverts. 

---

###### Our Collections
#### However, we can and should choose to be more intentional about our collecting. 


---

###### Task: Why do people or institutions collect? 
#### Using the examples provided on the Miro board and any other collections you can think of, list the reasons they exist or motivations for their use.

[https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO62zGmA=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO62zGmA=/)

## What doesn't get collected?

###### What doesn't get collected?

#### When looking for opportunities to create collections it is useful to consider gaps in existing collections, knowledge and stories.

???
the stories being told by large institutions are from a particular lense.
This leaves many gaps. Those often reflect societal inequalities. 
The drive toward decolonising various aspecst of our culture and society is a core example of this.

???
The collections of resources you are exposed to as designers in a british uni and studying in europe are affected by an anglocentric bias. 
In a lot of cases this represents unconscious or conscious bias in the system. 
A lack of attention to the world beyond traditional canons. This excludes many people. 
It also dilutes and narrows the world view of those who aren't exlcuded.

As an example during covid data about the effect of covid on black and latino  was not being collected at all 
Those subjects and the data collection are determined by the value of the data to some arbitrary goals. For example the amount of deaths from Covid in black and latino communities in the US. This data was not collected by the official authorities and therefore had to be collected by a grassroots organisation.

Gardening metaphor. 
Not using a Scythe (an agricultural tool for harvesting crops) for blindly collecting everything around us.
Instead trying to productively prune the over-abundance of available culture, so that the whole can grow stronger or more productively. 
Also, cutting off or discarding the parts that are harmful or dying.
