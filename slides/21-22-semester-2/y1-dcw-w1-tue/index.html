Introduction to HTML

#### What is HTML?

---

#### HTML _is_ the web

---

#### The lowest common denominator of the Web. The foundation. The rhythm section. The ladyfingers in the Web trifle.

[source](https://www.petelambert.com/journal/html-is-the-web/)

???
Frequently we look at websites in all their complexity and forget that at the base they are simply documents of text.

### What is HTML?

##### <u>H</u>yper<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage
##### It is a markup language. Something used to add _meaning_ and _structure_ to (usually) electronic text.

### What is HyperText?
.lc.lc-66[
##### Text (typically on screen) that contains references or links to other texts that can be immediately accessed.

##### Interlinked, potentially nonlinear or multilinear texts.

#### In reality the web includes much more than text. 

#### It includes image, video, audio and other interactive elements.

- Olia Lialina (unit sponsor)! made this piece in 1995. 
- Coming from cinema she used simple HTML and imagery to relay an evocative narrative
- It's a non-linear, intentionally fragmented story open to user navigation and reinterpretation

### So, how do we create hypertext?

.lc.lc-75[
##### We do this by creating `.html` files and adding HTML - hypertext markup language.

##### These are then interpreted by web browsers like Firefox.

### Making text into HTML 

##### HTML is something you apply to different pieces of content, like annotations or instructions to a computer to add meaning.

##### These annotations take the form of tags - also called elements.

### HTML Elements (or Tags)

##### An HTML <u>element</u> consists of a piece of <u>content</u></content> (in this case text) with an <u>opening</u> and <u>closing</u> tag.

.lc.lc-33[
###### We need to tell the computer that the title and text are different, and I use HTML to do this.

###### One way of doing this is to wrap the title in an `<h1>` tag and the text in a `<p>` tag.  ‚Üí

### Nested Tags
##### It is normal to nest tags within tags. For example to emphasise a word within a paragraph you would need to nest an `<em>` inside a `<p>`.

### Viewing the HTML

##### For simple pages, we can just open the `index.html` file in our web browser.

##### Right click on index.html in Finder/Explorer and open it with Firefox. Or drag the file into the open browser window.

---
template:tpl-slides-title
### Adding your own markup

##### In VS Code add the following HTML elements. 
- `<h1>` & `<h2>`
- `<p>` (around the paragraphs)
- `<em>` (around at least 2 words) 
- `<strong>` (around at least 2 words)

.lc.lc-75[
Don't forget they will each have an opening (e.g. `<p>`) and closing (e.g. `</p>`) tag surrounding an existing piece of text. <br><br>
Read this [html reference](https://doodybrains.github.io/hand-coding-round-robin/reference.html) for a quick recap.

---
template:tpl-slides-title
### Refresh the browser

.lc[
##### Once you've made some changes in VS Code return to the browser and _refresh_.

.rc.cover-left[![Browser Before](./img/vsc-browser-after.png)]

### What is CSS?

##### CSS stands for <u>C</u>ascading <u>S</u>tyle <u>S</u>heets

##### You use it to control how an HTML page looks. We do this by defining presentational _rules_ that attach to specific HTML content.

---

template:tpl-slides-title
class: bespoke-code-small
### Adding CSS rules (styles)

##### We add visual styles to our HTML using CSS rules. 
.lc.lc-75[
##### These rules affect selected HTML tags and change specific properties, for example changing the `color` and `background-color` properties of all the `<em>` tags.  
]

---
### A CSS Ruleset example

.oc[
![CSS Ruleset](./img/css-rule.png)
]

---

### Adding your own rules
Styles can be written in various places. For our purposes we'll be writing them in a `.css` file that lives next to our `index.html`.

### Add your own ruleset


![New CSS Ruleset](./img/vsc-newcssruleset.png)
---

### Add your own ruleset

##### How do you know what values I can add to, for example, `font-weight` or `font-size`? 
<br>
![New CSS Ruleset](./img/css-rule-new.png)

---

### Start with these properties

##### Each property on this [cheat sheet](https://gfte.notion.site/HTML-CSS-Cheatsheet-368d5f78741244088faf7d642364f1e9) has a link to the W3 Schools page that explains the property. 
<br>


---
### Specifying Colour in CSS

##### If the property value is a colour you can use:
- ##### Hexidecimal values (e.g. `#ff00ff`)
- ##### RGB values (e.g. `rgb(255, 0, 0)`)
- ##### A descriptive colour word (e.g. `red`, `blue`, `coral`). 
<br>
The list of descriptive colour words are in the [cheat sheet](https://gfte.notion.site/HTML-CSS-Cheatsheet-368d5f78741244088faf7d642364f1e9)

---

### Bonus task

- ##### Add a ruleset to change the `background-color` property of the whole page
- ##### In that same ruleset add a property to change the `background-image` property to [a repeating pattern](https://looneypatterns.com/)
- ##### Change the text and background colour to an [accessible colour contrast combination](http://clrs.cc/a11y/)

---

### Inspecting your HTML in the browser

This allows you to see what your HTML is doing in the browser and modify the CSS rules live.

*<img src="https://uxd-lcc.org/html.jpg" />
```

---
template:tpl-slides-title
class: bespoke-code-small
### Anchors and Images

##### Both of these elements need an attribute to function correctly. 

```html
*<a href="https://html.energy/">HTML Energy</a>
```
```html
*<img src="https://uxd-lcc.org/html.jpg" />
```

---
class: bespoke-code-medium
### Anchors (i.e. links)
##### A link will surround a piece of text (or other elements including images) and connect your HTML page to another. 

```html
<a href="https://html.energy/">HTML Energy</a>
```

---

template:tpl-slides-title
### Images
.lc.lc-75[
##### So far we've used HTML elements that surround a piece of text with a closing and opening tag. 


]
.rc.rc-25[
<br>
<br>
`<p>`content`</p>`
]

---
template:tpl-slides-title
### Images
.lc.lc-75[
##### However when adding an image in HTML there is no text to surround. 

##### Instead it has a source URL:
<a target="_blank" href="https://uxd-lcc.org/html.jpg">`https://uxd-lcc.org/html.jpg`</a>

]
.rc.rc-25[
<br>
### üèû
]

---
class: bespoke-code-medium

template:tpl-slides-title
### Images

##### And that URL needs to go inside the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag.
```html
<img src="https://uxd-lcc.org/html.jpg"/>
```


---
class: bespoke-code-small

### Add an Anchor & Image

##### Add an `<a>` tag around a word in one of your paragraphs. Find an appropriate URL/webpage to add to the `href` attribute.

##### Find an image hosted online already (right-click, then Copy Image Link) and add the image link to the `src` attribute of the image tag 

---
class: bespoke-code-small
template:tpl-slides-title

### Adding a `class` attribute

##### You can add a `class` attribute to any tag. In this example we're adding it to our `<p>`.

```html
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say 30 years [..]</p>

*<p class="highlight">Mind you, this is by no [..]</p>

<p>Nothing new there <a href="http://html.energy">fire</a>[..]</p>

<p>This book is for designers who want to be[..]</p>

<img src="https://uxd-lcc.org/html.jpg" />
```

---
class: bespoke-code-small
template:tpl-slides-title
### Adding a `class` attribute

##### Adding a `class` allows us to use a CSS selector to highlight that particular `<p>` element. 

```html
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say 30 years [..]</p>

*<p class="highlight">Mind you, this is by no [..]</p>

<p>Nothing new there fire is two million years old</p>

<p>This book is for designers who want to be[..]</p>
```
