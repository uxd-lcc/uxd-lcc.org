#### What is HTML?

---

#### HTML _is_ the web

#### The lowest common denominator of the Web. The foundation. The rhythm section. The ladyfingers in the Web trifle.

Frequently we look at websites in all their complexity and forget that at the base they are simply documents of text.

### So, how do we create hypertext?

.lc.lc-75[
##### We do this by creating `.html` files and adding HTML - hypertext markup language.

##### These are then interpreted by web browsers like Firefox.

### Making text into HTML 

##### HTML is something you apply to different pieces of content, like annotations or instructions to a computer to add meaning.

##### These annotations take the form of tags - also called elements.

### HTML Elements (or Tags)

##### An HTML <u>element</u> consists of a piece of <u>content</u></content> (in this case text) with an <u>opening</u> and <u>closing</u> tag.

.lc.lc-33[
###### We need to tell the computer that the title and text are different, and I use HTML to do this.

###### One way of doing this is to wrap the title in an `<h1>` tag and the text in a `<p>` tag.  ‚Üí

### Viewing the HTML

##### For simple pages, we can just open the `index.html` file in our web browser.

##### Right click on index.html in Finder/Explorer and open it with Firefox. Or drag the file into the open browser window.

---
template:tpl-slides-title
### Adding your own markup

##### In VS Code add the following HTML elements. 
- `<h1>` & `<h2>`
- `<p>`
- `<em>`
- `<strong>`

.lc.lc-75[
Don't forget they will each have an opening (e.g. `<p>`) and closing (e.g. `</p>`) tag surrounding an existing piece of text. Read this [html reference](https://doodybrains.github.io/hand-coding-round-robin/reference.html) for a quick recap].

template:tpl-slides-title
### Refresh the browser

##### Once you've made some changes in VS Code return to the browser and _refresh_.

### More about HTML Elements

##### However when adding an image in HTML there is no text to surround. 

##### Instead it has a source URL:
