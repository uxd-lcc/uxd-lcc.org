.lc.lc-75[
##### We're in _Survey Season_, which means you're asked to contribute your experiences, thoughts and concerns about the course and wider university.

[Survey Season 2022 Presentation](https://artslondon.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/CanvasContent/Documents/Student%20surveys/Survey%20Season/Survey%20Season%202022/Survey%20Season%202022%20presentation.pptx?d=wbcbf09e42b144d39844bc35d5d595cee&csf=1&web=1&e=VXh8rB)
]

???
Multiple ways the university collects your feedback.
Different levels (unit, course, school).
Valuable to us because we can direcly respond.
CCM meeting. There was no feedback directly from the course reps so I'll meet with you in the next 2 weeks.

???
- Beverly Hills Internet 
- where non-specialist internet users made their first-ever webpages
- located in places. computer-related sites were placed in "SiliconValley" and those dealing with entertainment were in "Hollywood"

[One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age](https://anthology.rhizome.org/one-terabyte-of-kilobyte-age) - Olia Lialina & Dragan Espenschied<br>Available on Rhizome's Net Art Anthology
]

???
- in 2009, Yahoo pulled the plug on GeoCities
- millions of pages nearly blinked out of existence
- scraped, stored and made them available to explore an internet history


---
template: tpl-slides-title
layout:true

---

#### What does this tell us about the way people used webpages at the time?

???
- Websites were personal. (My)
- People felt like they owned these digital spaces. (My)
- It was an opportunity to connect. (Welcome!)
- They perceived them as 'space'. A place to be. (Home) <- Despite the lack of technical sophistication. Guestbooks. Visitor counts. 
- Who has a personal website that isn't a portfolio
- The web during the 90s was almost entirely made up of these
What can we intuit from this? 


---

- ##### Built by users. Everyone was invited. Everyone a maker.
- ##### Aesthetic reflected the needs of the users and the limitations technology of that time 
--

- ##### No Google! Browsing and chance discovery was the primary use
- ##### Therefore your website wasn't complete without a list of links to other sites


???
- No distinction between user, designer, coder. Everyone the same.
- Aesthetics reflect the affordances of the tech (repetition, low res antialised images, janky page structures, forcing images into a platform designed for text)
- There was no central repository. No google. Everyone had the reponsibility of connecting via links. 
- Even when the [first (pre-Google) search engines](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/excite-channels.jpg) emerged they all created directories of links that you would browse by subject
- You were an architect as well as designer/maker
---
### A Vernacular Web


> bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.

Olia Lialina (2005), [A Vernacular Web: The Indigenous and The Barbarians](art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/)


???
- Professor for new media and interface design at Merz Akademie, Stuttgart. 
- Also a Net artist and theorist of web design history.
- History hasn't been kind to these early adopters. 
- Doesn't make it into many canons of design history.  
- However it reflects a kind of digital folk art. 
- Folk artists often self-taught, reflecting the cultural life of a community.

]


???
- Mostly for personal sites e.g. hobbyists, individual designers, artists  
- parameters and aesthetic signifiers are difficult to define
- as a movement it has almost certainly already been cannibalised into something new  (unclear what though?)- aligned with trends in graphic design more generally

---
template: tpl-slides-title
layout: true
---

### What are the characteristics of Web Brutalism?

- ##### Most websites are personal in nature
- ##### Rejection of the trend toward sanitised 'perfection'
- ##### Embracing hand-coding and imperfections that come with it
- ##### Designed to engage the viewer in a hostile way (Uncomfortable design?)


???

1. Similar to the Vernacular Web of the 90s
1. + rejection of the tools that produce them
1. instead embracing the raw material (in this case primitive HTML and aesthetically rough graphic form).
1. Reaction against homogenised, user-centred design. 
  - **Uncomfortable design?**


> Web designers‚Äîand our HCI counterparts and collaborators‚Äîare sometimes too quick to implement a validated solution to merely increase efficiency, to save time, as the design process evolves.

> Websites like Bloomberg Businessweek Features, Lifeactionrevival, The Drudge Report and, perhaps most well-known of all, Craigslist have been designed purposefully to inhibit ease-of-use and **to not appear professionally polished**. Brutalist websites are also intentionally built to be rough, to be coded so that they appear to be uncomfortable for many audiences and users to interact with. 

> Doing so will help more web designers break away from the trend of template-based uniformity and allow us to continue to innovate in tangible, meaningful and productive ways.

- Not a celebration or encouragement to follow any of these trends or be nostalic for a by-gone era. 
- a illustration of the complex relationship between cultural trends, technology, as well as corporations and governance.

---
template: tpl-slides-title
layout: true
---

#### Web Brutlism is (was?) a small scale reaction to the sanitised mainstream design trends.

???
- cursory survey of a few trends to illustrate a point
- not a universal canon of web design (doesn't exist) 
- a slice that shows the relationship between (mostly european/american) internet use, technology and design trends
- this description/timeline doesn't recognise aesthetics and trends outside a mostly euro-american lense. 
- It also doesn't account for any subcultures or marginalised groups which also create aesthetics to identify with. 
- queer design anecdote
  - Queer aesthetic as resistance
  - A visual language to indentify with (without freedoms to be openly part of LGBTQ) 
  - Vibrant, bold, with intense colour pallettes and storytelling with characters that promote values of acceptance/diversity.  

---

#### One of the lessons from Vernacular Web & Web Brutalism is the benefits of hand-coding websites.

---

#### Q: Why do we need to _code_ a website in this unit?

Small scale. Self-published. Driven by resistance to mainstream (politics, media, culture). Underground. Aesethetics that resist this.

- As the web evolves it needs chaperones and advocates who understand it's history, culture which as we've seen are connect to its fundamental nature. (Consider the debate we're currently having over NFTs and web3)

Not everything has to be Fb scale to be good. 
There's joy in the small and slow. Joys of craft.

##### The homogenised appearance of the web is reflected in the limited, filtered view of the web promoted by the major online tech platforms.

???
The culture of use today, is different within communities, across the world and demonstrates a fragmented internet - not simply accessible to all equally. 

For a large part of the world, [Facebook is the internet](https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/)

Indonesians surveyed by Galpaya told her that they didn‚Äôt use the internet. But in focus groups, they would talk enthusiastically about how much time they spent on Facebook.

#### Most of us experience a relatively small section of the internet; page 1 of Google. Who does this represent?

--

#### The basic logic of Google search ranking algorithms create a ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô bias.


???
When you open a typical browser window and begin an internet search query, what you see on the first page of results is a reflection of relative popularity as well as profit driven hierarchy. 

The basic logic of what to privilege evolved from identifying what pages were most clicked and linked to by others on the web, easily leading to a ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô bias.

- Blackbird web browser got its wings in 2008
- surface African American news websites and blogs
- Severe backlask against the idea of a browser specifically to serve black communities. 'Where is the Whitebird?'. Ignorant of the fact that what we already have this by default.

###### Learning Outcomes (Knowledge)
#### Demonstrate an awareness of fundamental principles of design and coding for the web whilst considering its capacity for increasing or decreasing privacy, _openness and inclusion_.

???
The politics of visibilty run deep into the ill-health of the internet. One of the many aspects of the internet we, as designers, should be conscious of. Something more innocuous is the cookie consent UX issue. 

Resistance to issues and promoting positive practices is something we want you to engage in through set reading and further personal research

- for example the Internet Health Report produced by Mozilla Foundation (makers of the Firefox browser).
