                My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights—or very early mornings—when I left the Fillmore <em>half-crazy</em> and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket...booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of <strong>Oakland and Berkeley</strong> and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change).
            </p>

                There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning...

                I've never heard of a <strong>650 Lightning</strong>. What is that? <em>Also, what were you on that night?</em> And did you win?
