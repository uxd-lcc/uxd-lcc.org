Digital Gardening
]]

---

- An approach to sharing knowledge in public 
- An antidote to the 'stream' mode of consuming and publishing knowledge. (antithesis to infodemic of social media, continuous news, etc)

---

- Ways of writing, storing, connecting knowledge that reflect our own way of thinking/knowing.
- Knowledge always 'becoming'.  Not complete. In process. 
- Accepting that the documents that help us think can also be in the same state. 

---

- Advocates see DG as intrinsically linked to the structures of the web. 
- A return to the way the web emerge as an interlinked knowledge space. 
- Where individuals curated their own online 'gardens'.

> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.

- A good example of how a digital garden could work pre-dates the internet/web. 
- In an article that predicted and inspired the development of the web.
- Written in 1945 about a fictional device called a memex. The article was called 'As We May Think' by Vannevar Bush.

The memex (a portmanteau of “memory” and “index“) is the name of the

> First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, **he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together**.

> Thus he goes, **building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it** by a side trail to a particular item.

> When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants.

> He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. **Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.**

### As We May Think 💭

.lc.lc-75[
It was a speculation on how we would _think with_ machines. 

Vannevar Bush described the possibilities of the Memex in great detail and it became an inspiration for  those engineers creating the technology of the web in the 90s - in particular hypertext.

### What are some core principles of DG? 

---

- Build a knowledge-base around a subject or subjects
- To find and create connections.  ([Topography over timelines](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621774501/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/topographytimelines_shrink_jxgw9l.png))
- To revisit and reflect. Walk through & tend to the garden.
---
- Revisit previous ideas, remove, amend, add, update, arrange, rearrange.  
- Imperfection is ok and expected. WiP ideas can sit next to more fully formed thoughts.
