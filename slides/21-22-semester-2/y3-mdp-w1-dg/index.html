### Motivations behind Digital Gardening
- An approach to sharing knowledge in public 
- An antidote to the 'stream' mode of consuming and publishing (e.g. social media, blogs, real-time news) 

---

- Advocates saw/see it as intrinsically linked to the structures of the web
- A return to the way the possibilities of the web as an interlinked knowledge space 
- When individuals curated their own online 'gardens' for people to walk through (ownership)

> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.

### Memex

An example of how a digital garden could work pre-dates the web. From an article written in 1945 by Vannevar Bush about a fictional device called a **memex**, a portmanteau of “memory extension".

???
a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility".

> The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. [..] He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex.

> First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, **he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together**.  

---
class:middle
> Thus he goes, **building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it** by a side trail to a particular item. 

---
class:middle

> When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants.

> He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. **Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.**

### As We May Think 💭

.lc.lc-75[
The article was called 'As We May Think'. 

It was a speculation on how we would _think with_ machines. 
]

???

Vannevar Bush described the possibilities of the Memex in great detail and it became an inspiration for  those engineers creating the technology of the web in the 90s - in particular hypertext.

> you can annotate, change, add links to, summarize, and this is because the memex is a tool to think with, not a tool to publish with.

###### According to Digital Gardening advocates...

#### The web didn't live up to this. Digital Gardening tries to revive these principles. 


???
Attention driven, quanitity over quality. Connections as competition. 

---
### Qualities of D.G.
- Ways of writing, storing, connecting knowledge that reflect or support our own way of thinking and knowing
- Knowledge always 'becoming'. Not complete. In process.
- Accepting that the documents that help us think can also be in the same state

class: title-colour

#### In Summary

---

- Build knowledge incrementally, over time, (in public). Collect, analyse, connect.
- Create connections. A [topography](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621774501/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/topographytimelines_shrink_jxgw9l.png) of ideas and knowledge. 
- Revisit and reflect. (Walk through the garden)
- Remove, amend, add, update, annotate, arrange & rearrange. (Tend to the garden)
---
- Allow the whole to remain imperfect whilst working on the granular level
- Work in progress sit next to more fully formed thoughts or analysis

---

#### In comparison to a learning journal or process documentation...

A learning journal is more reflective, narrative documentation of learning. More personal and reflective. 

Process documentation...
