      <description>BA (Hons) User Experience Design at London College of Communication was one of the first UX courses at undergraduate level to be created 4 years ago.
During the 3 year undergraduate at UAL we offer a holistic art and design education that encourages independent, creative and critically minded students to develop as capable and responsible practitioners. The course specialism is the creation and interrogation of digital platforms, media and emergent technologies.</description>
